Hi,

This is Marcin (mplpl). 
I'm an experience developer with practical knowledge of C/C++, Objective-C, Python, Swift, Java and more.
I'm developing software for macOS, iOS/iPadOS as well as for Windows and Linux. 
I also port software for Amiga platforms (especially for MorphOS).

Regards to all ...
